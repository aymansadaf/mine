      <h2>Before I ask you something…</h2>

      <p>
        I hope you know how much you mean to me. You are the person I admire the most and
          you are irreplaceable to this heart of mine. I have never in my life been so sure of
          anything in my life. Of course it comes with moments of anxiousness and ups and downs, but baby
          I hope you know that my seatbelts are tied tightly and I will make sure your one is tightly done too 😤
      </p>

      <p>
        I promise you my baby, everytime you wake up I'll make your start as good as it can possibly be.
          I will shower you down with soft kisses all over your face 😤😤😤 I'll baby you and always make sure that you're taken care of 😤.
          You are a gem and I'm truly lucky to have found you. You are my gift and I don't know till this date what I have done to receive it.
          It still feels like a dream like the time I found out you feel the same way towards me 🥺 It's a dream from which I never wanna wake up from 🥺
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like the background picture tells a story about how we progressed this far, every passing day we are creating a new story to share with our kids or just to laugh over while drinking coffee in our 60s.
          The destination sure looks uncertain but we know we are headed there. So let's enjoy the ride, laugh a little harder, live a little more, miss each other but make sure to calm ourselves knowing that you have your entire life left to tolerate my immature and often annoying ass 🙄
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly but not the least, I have two things to tell you. Thank you and Sorry. Thank you for tolerating my intolerable ass and still never complaining out loud about it. And i'm sorry for being the pain in the ass in the first place 😩 but I hope you always find that little extra patience needed to keep your sanity 😭
          Because I truly love you behind all that pain and toxic habits that I carry. I fight everyday to make them go away and I'm truly hopeful that one day I will make it happen. Lastly I have only one request:
      </p>
