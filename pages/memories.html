      <p>
        The late talks. The random laughs.
        The quiet moments that meant more than words.
        The way it felt so reassuring without any big words.
        The silent kind of peace you brought into my life.
        The bond we silently grew <3
        These are the memories I carry with me.

        You bring warmth, comfort, and peace in a way no one else does. I just wanna spend the rest of my life growing together with you and bringing a cute smile to your face everyday in doing so 🥺
